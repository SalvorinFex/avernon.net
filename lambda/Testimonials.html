				&nbsp;<p class="style2">July 21, 2009&nbsp; I have been a client of Kurt 
				Roesener for more than two years. He was referred to me after I 
				had gone to my carrier for assistance and then to Geek Squad (at 
				$125. per hour) to no avail. I had a problem neither of them 
				could solve.<br />
				I then called Kurt in desperation. He analyzed my problem 
				immediately and solved it in a few minutes. He is knowledgeable, 
				courteous and most of all, tenacious in his problem solving. I 
				have used him many times since and he continues to be all of the 
				above.<br />
				I would happily recommend Kurt for any computer or program 
				problem. I wish him the best as he launches his own company and 
				will surely call on him again.<br />

				I needed a battery for the clock of my Hewlett-Packard 
				&quot;Presario&quot; computer.&nbsp; I also have a 386 computer which had been 
				lacking a clock battery for a long time, but I had been putting 
				up with the&nbsp;date problem.&nbsp; I decided to kill two-birds with one 
				stone and would get batteries for both computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took 
				both computers to &quot;Best Buy&quot;.&nbsp; The first person I approached, 
				asked &quot;why do you need a battery for your computer&quot; [real 
				intelligent!].&nbsp; I finally found someone who understood my 
				requirement.&nbsp; He proceeded to look at my 386 first -- had 
				trouble identifying the battery -- and ended up taking 
				components out of the computer.&nbsp; I told him to replace 
				everything and concentrate on my &quot;Presario&quot;.&nbsp; When I got home, I 
				discovered that my 386 was no longer working.&nbsp;<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I panicked.&nbsp; Somewhat later, I mentioned my 
				dilemma to a friend&nbsp;who said that he would ask his son Kurt 
				Roesener if he could help.&nbsp; Kurt managed to copy the contents of 
				my 386&#39;s disk before it died completely and then rebuilt the 
				computer.&nbsp; The bottom line is that Kurt not only got me out of 
				that pickle, but upgraded my 386 to a 586 by installing a new 
				mother-board (which has a new battery -- my original problem) 
				and&nbsp;much more memory.&nbsp; He even installed a &quot;Zip Disk&quot; unit.&nbsp; I 
				am very happy with Kurt&#39;s work.&nbsp; My 386 computer works fine now 
				and is much faster.&nbsp;</p>

				Mr. Roesener has an in depth knowledge of computer systems; both 
				in how they&#39;re designed and how they operate.&nbsp; He can explain in 
				my terms what&#39;s going on and how the issues is going to be 
				resolved.&nbsp; Highly recommended.&nbsp;</span></p>

				We have been very pleased with the computer repair services 
				provided by Kurt Roesener. Kurt came out to our home to look at 
				our computer, ran some tests and determined he had to take it 
				back to his shop for further work. Kurt called later, describing 
				the problem and listed multiple options for correcting the 
				hardware and software problems. We also had Kurt install 
				additional upgrades, such as a card reader and USB ports, which 
				he installed for a small additional charge. <br />
				<br />
				As an additional service for customers, he installs software on 
				the customer’s machine so he can remotely view your screen and 
				diagnose subsequent problems without even having to make a house 
				call. <br />
				<br />
				Kurt has an extensive background in computer repair and set up 
				and is very professional to work with, offering his services for 
				a very reasonable fee. We have recommended him to many of our 
				friends and neighbors. <br />
				<br />

				We are so glad that Kurt Roesener is starting up his own 
				business. He has helped us out with our computer more times than 
				I can count. He has fixed it when no one else could. We highly 
				recommend him for any problems that may come up with your own 
				computer. He is fast and reliable and has never failed us. We 
				wish him well with his new business!<br />
				&nbsp;<br />

				Stan and Kathy Cole</em></strong><br />

				I worked with Kurt for many years when he was a supervising 
				technician. &nbsp;His goal was to ensure installation of computer 
				systems at retail locations like stores or theme parks went 
				efficiently and smoothly. &nbsp;The work was conducted in compressed 
				time windows while stores were closed or before pressure packed 
				grand openings.<br />
				In every instance, Kurt&#39;s knowledge, experience, and planning 
				led to systems we were very proud of. &nbsp;He had an answer and a 
				plan for every possibility and work was always completed to rave 
				reviews from management.<br />
				Kurt&#39;s experience with computer systems is thorough, hands-on 
				knowledge. &nbsp;He thirsts to stay on top of whatever is new but has 
				the experience to manage and repair systems that are very old. 
				&nbsp;You will get the same professionalism Kurt displays whether the 
				service is for a Fortune 500 company or a personal computer at 
				your own home.<br />
