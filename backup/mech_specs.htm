<h2><font face="Lucida Console">Mechassault Mech Specs</font></h2>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Atlas</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 100 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser (x4)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Autocannon (x4)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Javelin Missile (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> None<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> AMS </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">The biggest and baddest of the nineteen mechs, 
the Atlas is a force to be reckoned with. It has the most armor and some of the 
deadliest weapons. While most mechs have one strong weapon, a second decent 
weapon, and a third weak weapon, the Atlas features three mighty armaments. The 
pulse lasers, especially when upgraded, are fast and great for close combat. The 
autocannon is a personal favorite, as it can easily tear apart smaller mechs. 
The javelin missiles may be our least used, but not least loved. All around, the 
Atlas is the big guns. But all that armor and weaponry comes at a price. It's 
slow and it can't use jump jets, leaving it susceptible to more agile enemies. 
Definitely not a mech to go toe-to-toe with, the Atlas has an incredible amount 
of thump. If you love strolling into the middle of combat, taking a pounding and 
then blowing up the foolish few who don't run, then you need to slide into the 
cockpit of an Atlas. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Belial</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 50 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Gauss Rifle (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> None </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Drop the PPC cannons, but add twin Gauss rifles 
and what do you get? A nice, near-equal alternative to the Uziel. For those who 
don't want to charge there weapons, the Belial is a good alternative to its 
sister mech. While you lose the PPCs, you will come away with three solid 
weapons instead of just two. The Pulse Laser serves as a nice addition and the 
Gauss rifle is far better than some piddly machine guns. However, you won't get 
the benefit of the Uziel's AMS defensive system, which can draw away enemy 
missiles. With no defensive special, it's quite a trade off simply to have three 
mid-level weapons. But, as always, the choice is yours. But, uh, this shouldn't 
be it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Bowman</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 65 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Laser (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Machine Gun (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Hammer Rocket (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> AMS </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">If there's any chicken whose head is worth 
saving, it's the Bowman. With the same speed and armor as its cousin, the Bowman 
has better weapons and AMS defensive specialty. The lasers aren't bad, but 
unlike Pulse Lasers, they take time to refresh. With two machine guns, you have 
a bit more of an effective punch up close, but it's still not a very effective 
weapon. Instead, nail enemies with your lasers and then blast them to 
smithereens with your dual Hammer rockets. The Hammer rockets, as you may or may 
not remember, fire straight, but then latch on to a target and after a few 
seconds explode. This isn't just for blowing up mechs though. With a delayed 
explosion, the Hammer rocket can be a great way to take out enemies with 
collapsing buildings and bridges. Hit a bridge, lure an enemy onto it, and then 
watch as the Hammer explodes. Sayonara. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Catapult</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 65 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser (x4)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> None<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Javelin Missile (x4)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> Target Jamming </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Essentially the <i>MechAssault</i> version of a 
Chicken Walker, the Catapult (and its variant, the Bowman) has no arms. With its 
chicken legs and heavy weapon mountings, the Catapult is a slow beast. With good 
armor and jump jets, a lack of mobility isn't too much of a problem. The 
Catapult comes to bear with a four-pack of Javelin missiles and a very effecting 
Pulse Laser. However, with no ballistic weapon, this is one chicken that you may 
not wanna ride (you do like riding chickens, though, don't you?). The Target 
Jamming is definitely a plus, but with only two weapons (though both strong) and 
slower speed, this isn't the choice among the 65-70 ton mechs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Cougar</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 35 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Autocannon<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Javelin Missile (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> None </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Compact and fast, the Cougar has jump jets, which 
is important for such a light mech. The Puma has a nice assortment of weapons 
including it's pulse lasers and an autocannon that packs a punch. The jump jets 
are a definitely plus, but having no special defensive power makes it pale 
compared to its Puma variant. Without a NullSig or target jamming ability, the 
Cougar must stay in motion, avoiding attacks with its agility. Not a good choice 
to take directly at a heavy mech, the Cougar can be useful in team play as a 
sort of freelancer, widdling down other mechs as it passes by. It's a tough 
choice, though, in an all-out deathmatch, because some fool will always pick a 
Thor or Atlas and end the fun right there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Elemental</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 5 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> None<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b>None </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">One of our personal favorites, just because it's 
so difficult to win in, an Elemental is just a person in an power-armored suit. 
They're fast, small, and agile, but they have the weakest weapons in the entire 
game. The pulse laster and crossbow missile are pretty insignificant against 
heavily armored mechs like the Atlas, but by moving a lot to avoid fire, it's 
not too difficult to take out weaker mechs. Elementals are tough to hit as long 
as they don't remain stationary. While it's tough taking an Elemental solo, they 
are very useful in team play. Or, if you want a challenge, take seven 
Elemental's against a Mad Cat or a Thor and see who comes out on top. This is 
the one and only time it's acceptable to pick an annoying, high-pitched brat 
voice. There's something charming about a group of Elemental's squealing with 
delight after they've fragged an Atlas. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Hackman</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 35 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> None<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Gauss Rifle<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> None<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> NullSig </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Though Owens and Hackman may sound like the 
marquee for some trashy Hollywood effects movie, the mech combo has no relation 
to the two actors. The Hackman is a better choice than the Owens, though as the 
Gauss Rifle is more effective from a longer range. With no jump jets, the 
Hackman must rely on foot speed, of which it has plenty. The addition of NullSig, 
allowing the Hackman to become invisible, gives it a definite edge over its 
cousin. Go invisible, stalk slowly from the edges of the map, and hit enemies 
with your missiles. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Kit Fox</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 30 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> None<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Hammer Rocket<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> NullSig </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">While most variants tend to be slightly weaker 
versions of the originals, the Kit Fox is actually a much more effective mech 
than the Uller. Though it has no ballistic weapon, the Kit Fox has the awesome 
Hammer rocket, which shoots straight but does massive damage. But what makes the 
Kit Fox a winner over the Uller is its defensive capability. Using NullSig, the 
Kit Fox can become invisible. Using power will hinder the effect, so you have to 
move slowly and not fire a weapon to stay completely invisible. However, if you 
do use jump jets, fire a weapon, or move quickly, you will still remain 
transparent and difficult to see from a distance. This makes the Kit Fox a 
deadly enemy from far away. Go invisible, charge up that Hammer rocket, and 
blast an enemy mech from far away. A great choice for a light mech.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Mad Cat</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 75 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> PPC (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Machine Gun (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Javelin Missile (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> None<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> Target Jamming </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">The Mad Cat has a little less tonnage than the 
Atlas, but what it loses in armor it gains in speed. While not nearly the 
speediest of mechs, it's got great speed for a heavy mech. There are no jump 
jets, but hey you've got two solid weapons. The machine gun, however, is weak. 
Even up close these little guns just won't do much damage. Get a ballistic 
upgrade and then use the machine gun, but outside of that, stick with missiles 
and the wonderful PPC here. Missiles, well, you know what those can do. They 
track, they blow things up, they're nice. But it's the PPC that garners the 
love. One of the few weapons in <i>MechAssault</i> that can be charged, the PPC 
cannons are a terror when fully upgraded. The best strategy is to hold them 
charged up as you hunt down a mech, that way you are ready to unleash a powerful 
blast the moment they show their metal face. You can then use the Mad Cat's 
speed to back off and hide behind a building or other structure, recharge the 
PPC and pop around another corner to blast. A few shots from the PPC and most 
enemies are toast. You can also switch quickly to the missiles, which offers a 
nice one-two punch. If you want a more speed but still wanna be able to run into 
combat full-steam, you just found your dream mech. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Mad Dog</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 60 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Autocannon<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile (x4)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> None<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> None </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Of the mid-range mechs for today, the Mad Dog 
gets our pick. As fast and well-armored as the Vulture, the Mad Dog has much 
better punch. No, it doesn't have jump jets, nor does it have any defensive 
specialties, but that won't stop you from kicking ass. All three weapons are 
strong, with the Pulse Laser firing quick and doing plenty of damage after an 
upgrade, the Autocannon slow to refresh but damaging when it connects, and the 
four-pack of Crossbow missiles which can easily jack up even the most powerful 
mech. The true power of the Mad Dog is revealed with upgrades. A single upgrade 
on the missiles will make for one of the best smacks in the entire game. And 
upgrade a second time for true power. With two missile upgrades, we were able to 
take out an Atlas and a Thor (yeah, both were coming down on us at once) in 
under a minute. Now that's some might.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Owens</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 35 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> None<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Machine Gun (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> None<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> Target Jamming </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">One of our least favorite mechs, the Owens has no 
energy weapon, limiting it's arsenal variety. Further, it has a fundamental 
design flaw. The machine guns are pretty good here, but these are meant for 
close combat. But you won't survive too long bringing an Owens face-to-face with 
one of the heavier mechs, making those machine guns sort of pointless. The 
target jamming will help, since it keeps missiles from locking on to you, but it 
only works if you're gonna keep moving. Stay on the move, try and avoid trouble, 
and pound mechs from far away with your missiles. Otherwise you'll be in the 
scrap-heap in no time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Prometheus</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 100 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Laser (x3)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Gauss Rifle (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Hammer Rocket (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> None<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> AMS </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">The variant on the Atlas, the Prometheus has a 
little less armor, but packs a different kind of punch. The triple laser is a 
nice touch, but takes a bit of time to reload. No, where the Prometheus kicks 
ass is with the Hammer rocket. The Hammer shoots straight, can't track, but when 
it does hit, it actually attaches itself to the victim. A few seconds later, the 
charge overloads and does some major damage to the victim. Effective and it 
looks suh-weet. Like the Atlas, Prometheus has an AMS defense. This releases a 
heat flare near the mech, which attracts heat-seeking missiles. It refreshes 
slowly, but is a great way to avoid several loads of incoming missiles. Of 
course, the best way to avoid taking fire is to frag every mech in your way with 
that sweet Hammer Rocket. Not as good as the Atlas, but the Prometheus is a nice 
change of pace. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Puma</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 35 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> PPC<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Machine Gun (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> NullSig </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Oh, thank goodness for variants. If there's one 
light mech to choose, Puma is it. Fast, decent armor, some fine weaponry, and 
the beauty of NullSig make this cream of the light mech crop. We've already 
expressed our love for NullSig and PPC and the two combined make for a wonderful 
partnership. Though the machine guns are a bit weak, the Crossbow Missiles 
refresh quickly, giving you a solid arsenal for such a fast mech. Going 
invisible and charging your PPC is one of the most effective bushwacking 
strategies in <i>
<a href="http://xbox.ign.com/objects/479/479931.html" title="MechAssault"><b>
MechAssault</b></a></i>, but that's not the best. On a city level, wear down a 
skyscraper and then go invisible. Charge the PPC and wait for a mech to pass by 
the building. Totally unaware you're there in hiding, the fool will be easy 
fodder to a toppled skyscraper. Instant death. We've seen two Puma's make easy 
work of an Atlas on more than one occasion. Sweetness. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Summoner</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 70 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser (x4)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Autocannon (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Hammer Rocket<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> None </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Like the Thor in most respects, but the Summoner 
has no defensive abilities. The four-gun Pulse Laser can be deadly and the dual-autocannons 
can cause some damage. Of course, we love the Hammer rocket. If you like the 
idea of the Thor, but want to enjoy battles from a further distance, the 
Summoner is a quality alternative. Though the autocannons are slow to refresh, 
those with good aim and patience can easily wear down their opponents. And if 
you do have to get up close and personal, you still have the Pulse Lasers to 
save your metal ass. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Thor</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 70 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Laser (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Machine Gun (x4)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile (x2)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> Target Jamming </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Looking like the younger brother to the Atlas, 
the Thor packs a thunderous whallop. The lasers are good, but again take time to 
refresh. And dual crossbow missiles are always powerful. But the thing that sets 
Thor apart from all other mechs is that this is the one mech where machine guns 
are deadly. With four machine guns blasting at once, the Thor is a deadly foe up 
close. If you try and widdle down enemies with your missiles and lasers, you 
will never make it far. Use your armaments to your advantage and surprise your 
foe by busting them down with your rapid-fire machine guns. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Timber Wolf</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 75 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Pulse Laser (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Gauss Rifle (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile (x4)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> None<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> None </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">The Mad Cat variant, this is a smart choice if 
you dig on the Mad Cat design but wish the weaponry were different. Though the 
Timber Wolf lacks the sweet PPC cannons of the Mad Cat, it doesn't suffer from 
having a weak ballistic weapon. All three weapons are solid, though none are 
overpowering. This is for those who still wanna be the brute in battle but need 
more balance in their attack. The real advantage here is that any power-ups you 
find in battle will serve you well, because they will turn any of your three 
mid-level attacks into a stronger threat. The real drawback here is that the 
Timber Wolf has no special defensive capability. Not on the top of our list of 
mechs to hop into, the Timber Wolf is still worth a try, if nothing else so you 
can say you've driven one of everything. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Uller</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 30 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Laser (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> None<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> AMS </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">Weak but quick, the Uller isn't one you want to 
take head-on into combo. With some of the piddliest weapons in <i>MechAssault</i>, 
you've got to use some strategy when taking the Uller into combat. Both its 
lasers and missiles are ideal for long-ranged combat, which is where it's best 
used. Keep on the move, staying away from the slower mechs with short-ranged 
weapons. Though it will take quite a few shots to take down opposing mechs, a 
frag is still a frag. Best used as a compliment to a team with some heavier 
mechs, this is your mech if you want to run around shooting mechs in the back, 
hiding behind obstructions, and sniping enemies from long range. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Uziel</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 50 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> PPC (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Machine Gun (x2)<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Crossbow Missile<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> Yes<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> AMS </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">It's been well-established by now that the PPCs 
are top on our list of favorite mech weapons. Well, any mech with dual PPC 
cannons is especially deadly and therefore a certain fave. The dual machine guns 
aren't bad, but they are only for moments when you find a mech pressing the 
attack and forcing themselves up close on you. Otherwise you'll want to keep 
your distance and pummel enemies with your missiles and PPC cannons. With decent 
speed and armor, the Uziel isn't a bad choice, though there are better out 
there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console"><b><big>Vulture</big></b><br>
<b>Tonnage:</b> 60 tons<br>
<b>Energy Weapon:</b> Laser (x2)<br>
<b>Ballistic Weapon:</b> Machine Gun<br>
<b>Missile Weapon:</b> Javelin Missile (x4)<br>
<b>Jump Jets:</b> None<br>
<b>Defense/Special:</b> AMS </font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Console">There's only so much weight jump jets can support 
and the compact but powerful Vulture just can't get air thanks to it's tonnage. 
Though there's no jump jets, the Vulture still has decent movement. More 
importantly, it has three good weapons. The four-pack of Javelin missiles is 
were it is at. With a good refresh rate and with a lovely plume of smoke emitted 
with each shot, the four-pack is one of the better missile sets in the game. And 
when you upgrade these missiles, watch out. Streams of missiles will tear your 
enemies to pieces. The machine gun is weak (noticing a trend here?), but the 
lasers do nicely, though they have a very slow refresh. The missiles will serve 
you well enough that the other weapons won't much matter. Add to this an AMS 
defense and you've got a good mid-range mech choice. </font></p>
